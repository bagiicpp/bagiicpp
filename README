# Hi, I'm Bagi 👋

Welcome to my corner of GitHub — a place where personal passion projects meet real-world solutions. I'm currently focused on building smart, clean, and user-first apps using technologies like React, Tauri, Rust, SQL, and a few experimental tools I like to break (and sometimes fix).

What I do

- Studying Informatics and Data Science at FERI in Slovenia
- Currently working on a business management app for my dad — learning tons in the process
- I love making sleek UIs with smooth animations (hello GSAP + Barba.js)

Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React, HTML/CSS/JS, Tailwind (sometimes), GSAP, Barba.js
- **Backend:** SQL, Rust, Spring Boot (Java), Tauri
- **Tools:** Git, Yarn, VS Code, Figma (for UI), GitHub Projects

## 📌 Projects I'm proud of

### 🎵 Vinyl Store
An online store built around a true story. Clean layout, JSON-powered product pages, and cart management — all handcrafted.

### 🧾 Business App (WIP)
Web-based platform for invoicing, scheduling, and reporting — replacing the old desktop app my dad used. Fullstack, secure, and built with love.

### 🎮 Hangman Game
Minimalist hangman built with pixelated squares and randomness. Just a little weekend experiment that turned into a UI playground.

> 💡 All my pinned repos have clear README files, screenshots, and real context behind the project.

- Rust + Tauri for desktop-quality web apps
- Svelte as a lightweight alternative to React
- Clean architecture and better backend patterns
- Ways to make my code more human-readable and future-proof
