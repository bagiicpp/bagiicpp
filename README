Hi, I'm Bagi ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my corner of GitHub â€” a place where personal passion projects meet real-world solutions. I'm currently focused on building smart, clean, and user-first apps using technologies like React, Svelte, Tauri, Rust, SQL, and a few experimental tools I like to break (and sometimes fix).

What I do

- Studying Informatics and Data Science at FERI in Slovenia
- Currently working on a business management app for my dad â€” learning tons in the process
- I love making sleek UIs with smooth animations (hello GSAP + Barba.js)


Tech Stack

- Frontend: React, HTML/CSS/JS, Tailwind (sometimes)
- Backend: SQL, Rust, Java Spring Boot


What I'm exploring

- Svelte as a lightweight alternative to React
- Clean architecture and better backend patterns
- Ways to make my code more human-readable and future-proof
